* Description
IPv4 Explorer is a simple, clean, web-based IPv4 address calculator. The tool currently reports the following for /unicast/ addresses:

If the input address is a valid source adress, the following information is reported. 
- dotted binary representations for all addresses
  - network (routing prefix) bits are highlighted
- Network address
- Broadcast address
- first and last usable addresses

IANA special registry information is reported by searching IANA's special registry data for a supernet that contains the input address.
